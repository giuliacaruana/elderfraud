        <h2> Phishing </h2>
        <p class="left">With more and more business being done online, whether it be shopping or banking, there is more risk to navigating the Internet on a daily basis. In a popular online scam known as "phishing," scammers send consumers an
          <span>e-mail that appears to be from a well-known source</span>, for example, an internet service provider or a bank. The victim is asked to <span> provide personal information</span>, like passwords or credit card numbers, which are then
          used by a scammer to commit fraud and spend the victim’s money.

      <span class="serif">So, how can you spot a Phishing email? </span><br><br>

      <span>Urgent Action Required</span> <br>
      <p>These are messages that threaten some kind of negative consequence unless urgent action is taken. Make sure to study the email for flaws or inconsistencies before making any quick decisions.</p><br>

      <span>Poor Spelling or Grammar</span><br>
      <p>These emails are sometimes crafted by non-English-speakers. Scan the email for unusual mistakes such as typos and grammatical incoherences to make sure you're not being scammed.</p><br>

      <span>Public Email Domains</span><br>
      <p>Legitimate organizations will never send emails from addresses that end in "@gmail.com" or "@live.com," for example. Look at the top of the email, next to the "From" field, and click on the sender's name to see their email address. Most
        organizations will have their own domain name. For example, Paypal uses "@mail.paypal.ca".</p> <br>

      <span>Suspicious Links or Attachments</span><br>
      <p>If the message is urging you to download an attachment or click on a suspicious link to take action, it might be a phishing email. Most of the time, a button is used instead of a link to hide the destination address. It's better to contact
        the sender through another means of communication, such as the email or phone number on their official website. Ask them if the email is legitimate.</p>

        <h2> Grandparent Scam </h2>
        <p class="left">Another popular scam, and perhaps one of the most immoral kinds, is what’s known as “the grandparent scam”, in which a scammer places a <span>call or message</span> to an elderly person and <span>pretends to be one of their
            grandchildren</span>. The scammers proceed to request money for a financial problem, like overdue rent or grocery money, and ask the victim to not tell any other family members about the “embarrassing” request.</p>

    <!-- TRICKS -->
    <div class="tricks slide-right show-on-scroll">

      <span class="serif">So, how can you spot the Grandparent Scam? </span><br><br>

      <span>The person is claiming they are your grandchild but will not say their name.</span><br>
      <p> This is because the scammer sometimes doesn't have this information, and is relying on a vulnerable person to guess who they are. If you get a call like this and you want to make sure the person is who they say they are, ask who it is, and
        ask another specific question that only the real person would know the answer to.</p> <br>

      <span>The person is claiming has been an accident, or an arrest, or a robbery.</span><br>
      <p> This is a common tactic used to scare older people.</p> <br>

      <span>“Don’t tell Mom and Dad!”</span> <br>
      <p> If the person on the phone says this, they are probably a scammer who wants you to act fast and not involve other people who might be suspicious of this scam.</p> <br>

      <span>The call comes late at night.</span><br>
      <p> The National Consumers League warns that scammers often call at night because they think older people might be tired or confused.</p>

        <h2> Sweetheart Scam </h2>
        <p class="left">Similar to the grandparent scam, you may also encounter what is known as a “sweetheart” or “romance” scam. Elderly men and women are sometimes targeted by scammers who develop a <span>fake online relationship </span> with
          them, eventually <span>asking for money</span> to help with financial problems.</p>

      <span class="serif">So, how can you spot the Sweetheart Scam? </span><br><br>

      <span>The person claims to live far away.</span> <br>
      <p> If this person is a scammer, they often have no intention of meeting their "Sweetheart" in real life.</p> <br>

      <span>The relationship is moving fast.</span> <br>
      <p> The scammer will try to develop a romantic relationship with the victim as quickly as possible to develop a sense of trust.</p> <br>

      <span>The person asks for money, and requests specific payment methods.</span><br>
      <p> The romance scammer may ask for money for travel, medical, or family expenses. If they ask for any kind of money, for example, a wire transfer or a preloaded gift card, beware.</p>

        <h2> Fake Prize <br>& Lottery Scams </h2>
        <p class="left"> In this case, fraudsters inform the victims, usually via e-mail, that they have <span> won some sort of prize</span>, like an all-expenses paid trip to the Bahamas or a free Apple MacBook. Before they can redeem their grand
          prize, the victim must <span>first pay a fee</span>, which is how the scammers make their money. If the supposed prize is cash, the victim receives a check, which they successfully cash into their bank account. But within a matter of
          days,the <span>fake check bounces</span>, the money is lost.

      <span>You have to pay to get the prize, or give financial information.</span><br>
      <p> Real prizes are free. If you are asked to pay a fee for "taxes," "shipping and handling charges," or “processing fees”, it's a scam. Do not wire money, send cash, pay with gift cards, or provide any financial information. It will be almost
        impossible to get your money back.</p>
